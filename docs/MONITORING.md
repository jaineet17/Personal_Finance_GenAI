# Monitoring Configuration for Finance RAG

This document outlines the monitoring approach for the Finance RAG application deployment in AWS, using free tier monitoring services.

## CloudWatch Monitoring

### CloudWatch Metrics

The following CloudWatch metrics are configured for monitoring:

1. **API Performance Metrics**
   - Request latency (p50, p90, p99)
   - API request count
   - API error rate
   - 4xx and 5xx response codes

2. **Lambda Metrics** (if using serverless)
   - Invocation count
   - Error count
   - Duration
   - Throttles
   - Concurrent executions

3. **ECS Metrics** (if using containers)
   - CPU utilization
   - Memory utilization
   - Running task count
   - Service events

4. **Database Metrics**
   - Connection count
   - Query latency
   - Storage utilization

### CloudWatch Alarms

Free tier CloudWatch alarms are configured for critical metrics:

1. **Availability Alarms**
   - API endpoint availability
   - 5xx error rate above 5%
   - Failed task count above threshold

2. **Performance Alarms**
   - API latency p99 > 1000ms
   - CPU utilization > 80%
   - Memory utilization > 80%

3. **Cost Protection Alarms**
   - Approaching free tier limits
   - Resource overutilization warnings

### CloudWatch Logs

Log groups are configured to capture application events:

1. **API Logs**
   - Request/response logging (sanitized)
   - Error logging with stack traces
   - Authentication events

2. **Infrastructure Logs**
   - ECS container logs
   - Task lifecycle events
   - Network activity logs

3. **Log Insights Queries**
   - Predefined queries for error analysis
   - Performance bottleneck detection
   - Security event monitoring

## Health Checks

### Endpoint Monitoring

1. **Route53 Health Checks**
   - Basic endpoint availability checks
   - Response time monitoring
   - Automated HTTP status verification

2. **Custom Application Health**
   - `/health` endpoint implementation
   - Dependency health reporting
   - Database connectivity checks

3. **Synthetic Monitoring**
   - Simple scheduled API tests
   - Basic user flow validation

## Notification System

### Free Tier Notifications

1. **Email Notifications**
   - Critical alarm notifications
   - Daily/weekly summary reports
   - Threshold breach alerts

2. **SNS Topics**
   - Alarm integration with SNS
   - Error aggregation and batching
   - Environment-specific notification groups

3. **GitHub Integration**
   - Create issues for critical errors
   - Link monitoring events to code

## Dashboard & Visualization

### CloudWatch Dashboards

1. **Application Dashboard**
   - Real-time metrics visualization
   - Error tracking widgets
   - API performance metrics

2. **Infrastructure Dashboard**
   - Resource utilization tracking
   - Deployment event timeline
   - Cost allocation visualization

3. **Custom Metrics**
   - Business-specific metrics
   - User engagement metrics
   - Feature utilization tracking

## Log Management

### Log Retention

1. **Retention Policies**
   - 7-day retention for high-volume logs
   - 30-day retention for critical logs
   - Log export for long-term storage (S3)

2. **Log Filtering**
   - Sensitive data filtering
   - Debug log suppression in production
   - Structured logging format

## Operational Procedures

### Monitoring Response

1. **Incident Classification**
   - Severity level definitions
   - Response time objectives
   - Escalation procedures

2. **Runbooks**
   - Common issue resolution steps
   - Restart procedures
   - Rollback instructions

3. **Post-Incident Analysis**
   - Root cause analysis templates
   - Metrics-based incident review
   - Continuous improvement process

## Staying Within Free Tier

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Log Volume Control**
   - Selective logging in production
   - Log sampling for high-volume endpoints
   - Debug level adjustment

2. **Metric Resolution**
   - 5-minute resolution for standard metrics
   - 1-minute resolution for critical metrics only
   - Custom metric batching

3. **Alarm Tuning**
   - Threshold optimization
   - Composite alarms to reduce noise
   - Alarm action throttling

## Future Enhancements

As the application grows beyond free tier:

1. **Advanced Monitoring**
   - Distributed tracing (AWS X-Ray)
   - Detailed user journey tracking
   - Machine learning-based anomaly detection

2. **Third-Party Integration**
   - Integration with PagerDuty/OpsGenie
   - APM tools like Datadog or New Relic
   - Log aggregation with ELK stack

3. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Custom monitoring dashboards
   - Business KPI integration
   - User experience monitoring
